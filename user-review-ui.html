actions are available on the change:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a id="submit"></a><code>Submit</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Submits the change and adds it to the merge queue. If possible the

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Submit</code> button is available if the change is submittable and

<li>
<p><a id="revert"></a><code>Revert</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reverts the change via creating a new one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Revert</code> button is available if the change has been submitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the <code>Revert</code> button is pressed, a panel will appear to allow
the user to enter a commit message for the reverting change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once a revert change is created, the original author and any reviewers
of the original change are added as reviewers and a message is posted
to the original change linking to the revert.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><a id="abandon"></a><code>Abandon</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Abandons the change.</p>

<p>When a change is abandoned, a panel appears that allows one to type a

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Restores the change.</p>

</div>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><a id="rebase"></a><code>Rebase</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rebases the change. The rebase is always done with content merge
enabled. If the rebase is successful a new patch set with the rebased
commit is created. If the rebase fails, there are conflicts that have
to be resolved manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the change does not depend on another open change, it is rebased
onto the tip of the destination branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the change depends on another open change, it is rebased onto the
current patch set of that other change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to change parent revision of a change. The new parent
revision can be another change towards the same target branch, or
the tip of the target branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Rebase</code> button is only available if
the <a href="access-control.html#category_rebase">Rebase</a> access right is

</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><a id="cherry-pick"></a><code>Cherry-Pick</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allows to cherry-pick the change to another branch. The destination
branch can be selected from a dialog. Cherry-picking a change creates a
new open change on the selected destination branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also possible to cherry-pick a change to the same branch. This is
effectively the same as rebasing it to the current tip of the
destination branch. This can be used to remove dependencies on other
open changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users can only cherry-pick changes to branches for which they are
allowed to upload changes for review.</p>

always listed first. The following magic files exist:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The available download commands depend on the installed Gerrit plugins.
The most popular plugin for download commands, the
<a href="https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/admin/repos/plugins/download-commands" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
download-commands</a> plugin, provides commands to checkout, pull and
cherry-pick a patch set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each command has a copy-to-clipboard icon that allows the command to be
copied into the clipboard. This makes it easy to paste and execute the
command on a Git command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If several download schemes are configured on the server (e.g. SSH and
HTTP) there is a drop-down list to switch between the download schemes.
Gerrit automatically remembers the download scheme that was last chosen
and selects this download scheme the next time the download commands
drop-down panel is opened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Patch-File</code> links provide the Git patch file for the currently
viewed patch set for download. The patch file can be base64 encoded or
zipped.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Archive</code> links allow one to download an archive with the contents
of the currently viewed patch set. The archive is offered in several
formats (e.g. tar and tbz2); which formats are available depends on the
configuration of the server.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="included-in">Included In</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For merged changes the <code>Included In</code> drop-down panel is available
through the overflow menu at the top. It shows the branches and tags
in which the change is included. E.g. if a change fixes a bug, this
shows which released versions contain the bug-fix (assuming that every
release is tagged).</p>

<h3 id="related-changes">Related Changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there are changes that are related to the currently viewed change
they are displayed in the third column of the change screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several lists of related changes and a tab control is used to
display each list of related changes in its own tab.</p>

<p>The following tabs may be displayed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a id="related-changes-tab"></a><code>Related Changes</code>:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tab page shows changes on which the current change depends
(ancestors) and open changes that depend on the current change
(descendants). For merge commits it also shows the closed changes that
will be merged into the destination branch by submitting the merge
commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The changes are sorted in the same way as the output of 'git log'. This
means the relationship between the changes can be inferred from the
position of the changes in the list. Changes listed above the current
change are descendants; changes below the current change are ancestors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For merged changes this tab is only shown if there are open
descendants.</p>

under review:</p>

<p>It means that the
currently viewed patch set depends on a outdated patch set of the
ancestor change. This is because a new patch set for the ancestor
change was uploaded in the meantime and as result the currently viewed
patch set now needs to be rebased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a descendant change is marked "not current" it means that an
old patch set of the descendant change depends on the currently viewed

and with the new patch set this dependency was removed.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><a id="indirect-descendant"></a>Indirect descendant:</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The selected patch set of the change is an indirect descendant of the
currently viewed patch set; it has a dependency to another patch set of
this change. E.g. this could mean that a new patch set was uploaded for
this change and the descendant change now needs to be rebased. Please
note that following the link to an indirect descendant change may
result in a completely different related changes listing.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Indicates a closed ancestor, e.g. the commit was directly pushed into

the user has accidentally pushed the commit to the wrong branch, e.g.
the commit was done on <code>branch-a</code>, but was then pushed to
